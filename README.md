# Adult-Census-Prediction

Project Objectives:

Data Exploration: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics and distributions of features in the dataset.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features as necessary.

Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.

Model Building: Build and evaluate machine learning models for the classification task, such as logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting.

Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

Model Interpretation: Interpret the models to understand which features are most influential in predicting income levels.


Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the Adult Census Income dataset. It contains demographic information, education, and occupation data for individuals. The target variable is binary, indicating whether an individual earns more than $50,000 annually.
